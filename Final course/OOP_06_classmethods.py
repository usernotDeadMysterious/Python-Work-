
# Class methods are called on the class itself, not on individual instances. This allows their use without needing to create a class instance. They are especially useful for actions relevant to the class as a whole, rather than actions limited to a single object. Here's an example:



class Book:
  def __init__(self, title, author):
    self.title = title
    self.author = author

  #regular method
  def describe_book(self):
    print(self.title, 'by', self.author)

  #class method
  @classmethod
  def books_in_series(cls, series_name, number_of_books):
    print('There are', number_of_books, 'books in the', series_name, 'series')

# Creating an instance of Book
my_book = Book("Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone", "J.K. Rowling")

# Using the instance method to describe the book
my_book.describe_book()

# Using the class method to display information about the series
Book.books_in_series("Harry Potter", 7)
