# When should you use static methods instead of class methods? Static methods don't accept the cls parameter, meaning they can't access or modify the class's state. They are useful when you require functionality that doesn't depend on the class's behavior or instance state and doesn't affect it. Essentially, static methods are suited for tasks that are self-contained and do not require knowledge of the class or instance.
# ðŸŒŸ Class methods are called on the class itself, not on individual instances

# ðŸŒŸ Class methods are defined using the @classmethod decorator and accept the cls argument

# ðŸŒŸ Static methods, defined with the @staticmethod decorator, are similar to class methods but do not have access to the class's state
