# Method overriding is a demonstration of another key concept in OOP - polymorphism. Polymorphism lets objects use methods in their own way, even if they share the same name.

# In this example, even though each animal in the animals list may be of a different subclass, the code can call sound() on each without needing to know its specific type.


# Parent class
class Animal:
  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name

  # Generic sound method for any animal
  def sound(self):
    print("Making a sound")

# Child class Dog
class Dog(Animal):
  def __init__(self, name, breed, age):
    super().__init__(name)
    self.breed = breed
    self.age = age
  
  # Overridden sound method for Dog
  def sound(self):
    print("Woof!")

# Child class Cat
class Cat(Animal):
  def __init__(self, name, breed, age):
    super().__init__(name)
    self.breed = breed
    self.age = age

  # Overridden sound method for Cat
  def sound(self):
    print("Meow!")

# Creating instances
my_dog = Dog("Jax", "Bulldog", 5)
my_cat = Cat("Lily", "Ragdoll", 2)

animals = [my_dog, my_cat]

for animal in animals:
  animal.sound()


#   ðŸŒŸ Inheritance enables a new class to inherit characteristics from an existing class

# ðŸŒŸ You can add unique attributes and behaviors to a child class

# ðŸŒŸ Method overriding allows you to modify the functionality of an inherited method

# ðŸŒŸ Abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism are three of the four fundamental principles of OOP
